			<h2 id="pressure-systems">I. Pressure Systems</h2>

			<ul>

				<li><p id="high-pressure"><u>High Pressure (northern hemisphere)</u></p>
				<p>Caused by cold, sinking air. Movement of air around a high pressure centre is clockwise, diverging away from the centre (anti-cyclonic).</p>

				<p>Fair weather- fewer clouds due to suppression of upward convective currents, light winds, good visibility. High pressure systems can stay stationary for long periods.</p>
				</li><br/>

				
				<li><p id="low-pressure"><u>Low pressure (northern hemisphere)</u></p>
				<p>Caused by hot, rising air. Movement of air aroind a low pressure centre is anti-clockwise and converging toward the centre (cyclonic).</p>

				<p>Bad weather- more clouds due to increased upward convetive currents, strong winds, precipitation, bad visibility. Often cause thunderstorms. Low pressure systems move 
				quickly and at an angle to the isobars seen on wx maps (faster in winter than summer).</p>
				</li><br/>


				<li><p id="troughs"><u>Troughs</u></p>

				<p>Elongated areas of low pressure [low pressure lines]. Passage of a trough follows surface level wind shift, clouds and precipitation. Often associated with fronts.</p>
				</li><br/>


				<li><p id="ridges"><u>Ridges</u></p>

				<p>Elongated areas of high pressure [high pressure lines] with a low pressure system on each side. Fair weather is associated.</p>
				</li><br/>


				<li><p id="cols"><u>Cols</u></p>

				<p>Neutral region between <b>two highs and two lows</b>. Weather tends to be unsettled. Fog is expected in winter and showers and thunderstorms in summer.</p>
				</li><br/>
			</ul><br/>

			<h2 id="altimetry">II. Altimetry</h2>
			<ul>
			
				<li id="effect-of-temperature"><p><u>Effect of temperature</u></p>

				<p>Rise in temperature <i>momentarily</i> increases the pressure of the air column which makes the air molecules spread vertically to try to maintain a 
				uniform pressure throughout its mass. This causes ambient air pressure to change <b>less</b> with increase in altitude. As a result, you have go higher than 
				normal for the same change in altimeter reading. Hence, the <b>true altitude increases</b> when the air is warm [typical in summer].</p>

				<p>Fall in temprature makes the cold air sink below causing steeper pressure changes with altitude. Hence, you have to climb less to see the same 
				change in altimeter reading which puts you at a <b>lower true altitude</b> [typical in winter]. </p>
				</li><br/>


				<li><p id="flying-into-different-temperature"><u>Flying in to a different temperature zone</u></p>

				<p>Just like your true altitude increases in warmer temperatures (and vice versa), flying in to a warmer zone - without resetting your altimeter QNH - will 
				put you at a <b>higher true altitude</b>, meaning you'll end up being <b>higher than you think</b>. The reverse is true for flying in to colder zones- you'll 
				end up <b>lower than you think</b>.</p>
				</li><br/>

				<li><p id="flying-into-different-pressure"><u>Flying in to a different pressure zone</u></p>

				<p>The higher the pressure value you set in your altimeter (Altimeter subscale setting or QNH), the higher of an altitude it will <b>indicate</b> at the same 
					pressure level. If you fly in to an area that has a lower pressure than where you were before, you need to dial down the QNH for the altimeter to show the 
					proper indicated altitude. Failure to do so will show a <b>higher indicated altiude than your actual/true altitude</b>, so you'll end up being <b>lower than 
					you think</b>. The reverse is true if you fly in to an area of higher pressure.</p><br/>

				<p><i>~ Remember ~</i> Your indicated altitude is still susceptible to the effects of temperature. Setting the correct pressure setting does not relieve you of the 
					responsibility to take in to account the error in your 	indicated altitude due to the actual temperature in the region you're in. Whatever regions you fly in will 
					still have you at a <b>much different true altitude</b> if their actual temperatures are too different from standard.</p></li><br/>

				
				<li><p id="true-alt"><u>True Altitude</u></p>

				<p>It's your real altitude found by correcting <b>IAlt AGL</b> for temperature <i>(AGL because the altimeter setting valid at any point is supposed to be the atmospheric 
					pressure observed on the ground below you reduced to sea level pressure, so the error is supposedly encountered after you climbed up from the ground below you, not 
					from SEA LEVEL!)</i>. <b>Your altimeter is always lying to you</b> and it is off by <b>4' per 1000' IAlt AGL per <sup>o</sup>C ISA deviation @ P.A.</b>. 
					So the formula for altitude correction becomes:</p>

				<div class="code-block">
					<p><i>Alt. Corr. = 4 &nbsp;x&nbsp; <sup>IAlt AGL</sup>/<sub>1000</sub> &nbsp;x&nbsp; ISA Temp deviation</i></p>
				</div>

				<p>Example:</p>

				<div class="code-block">
					<p>IAlt: 13,500'; A2952; OAT 25<sup>o</sup>C; Elev: 3000'</p>
					<p>P.A. = 13,900', I.S.A Temp @ 13,900' = 15 - 1.98 x 13.9 = -12.5<sup>o</sup>C; deviation = +37.5<sup>o</sup>C</p>
					<p>IAlt AGL = 13,500' - 3000' = 10,500'</p>
					<p><b>Alt. corr. = 4 x 10.5 x 37.5 = 1575'</b></p>
					<p><b>True ALT = 13,500 + 1575 = 15,075' <u>ASL</u></b></p>
				</div>

				<p>Alternatively, use the values for P.A., OAT and IAlt (CAlt) AGL on the <b>E6B</b> flight computer (produces slightly different answer, in the above example we get 
					T.A. = <b>15,000' ASL</b>).</p>
				</li><br/>


				<li><p id="actual-alt"><u>Actual altitude</u></p>

				<p>It's your actual height AGL or true altitude AGL, found by subtracting terrain elevation from true altitude AMSL.</p>
				<p>In the above example, Absolute ALT = 15,075' - 3000' = 12,075' AGL.</p>
				</li><br/>
			</ul><br/>

			<h2 id="heat-moisture">III. Heat &amp; Moisture</h2>
			<ul>

				<li><p id="temp-inversion"><u>Temperature Inversion</u></p>

				<p>A phenomenon where atmospheric temperature increases with altitude, or the standard lapse rate is <b>inverted</b>. Often caused due to radiation cooling of the surface 
					wherein the radiated heat heats up a higher level of the atmosphere and the air in immediate contact with the thus cool ground gets cooled from below [common at night]. 
					Strong inversions can also occur when cold air flows in to valleys and gets trapped while sinking air on leeward sides of mountains warm due to compression by 
					increasing atmospheric pressure without going all the way to the ground.</p>

				<p>Any convective activity that is resumed when the land is heated again gets <i>capped</i> at the warmer air layer as the rising moist air now spreads horizontally instead 
					of vertically. Usually leads to very stable weather. Visibility can be poor due to the entrapment fog, dew and pollution in the lower level below the warm layer. 
					Stratifrom clouds appear which may lead to light steady precipitation. <b>Wind shears</b> can be encountered after takeoff in the presence of a <b>strong temperature 
					inversion</b>.</p>

				<p>If convective activity is <i>too much</i> it can break through the inversion layer leading to strong thunderstorms.</p>
				</li><br/>

				<li>
				<p id="stability-instability"><u>Stability and instability</u><p>

				<p>Cooler air near the surface causes stable weather due to absence of heat as a convective lifting agent. Consequently, warmer air aloft contributes to stable weather 
					by restricting cloud formation which, along with the absence of orographic agents, reduces mechanical turbulence. However, the amount of convective energy suppressed 
					by the inversion will dictate the degree of unstable weather should the inversion get broken through by heavy convective activity.</p>

				<p>It should be noted, however, that the biggest determinant of atmospheric stability is the <b>environmental lapse rate</b>. The steepr it is, the more unstable the 
					atmosphere will be due to steeper temperature changes experienced by the rising air.</p>
				</li><br/>
			

				<li><p id="humidity-lapse-rate"><u>Humidity &amp; Adiabatic lapse rate</u></p>

				<p>Humidity is a measure of the amount of moisture contained by air. <b>Relative humidity</b> is the amount of moisture contained by air expressed as a percentage of 
					the total amount of moisture it can hold at a given temperature. A drop in temperature or addition of moisture can increase the relative humidity. 
					<b>Dew point</b> is the temperature that air must be cooled to to become saturated. Temperature/dew point spread is indicative of the chances of cloud and fog 
					formation.</p>

				<p>Sometimes air molecules within a parcel of air may release or absorb heat to or from other molecules in the same parcel instead of the surrounding atmosphere. 
					This is known as an adiabatic process.</p>

				<p>Unsaturated air cools faster than saturated air. The former cools at a rate of 3<sup>o</sup>C per 1000', known as the <b>Dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR)</b>. 
					The latter cools at a rate of 1.5<sup>o</sup>C per 1000', known as <b>saturated adiabatic lapse rate (SALR)</b>. Change in relative humidity/saturation of air 
					is the result of adiabatic heat exchange.</p>
				</li><br/>


				<li><p id="height-cloud-base-fz-lvl"><u>Height of cloud base & freezing level</u></p>

				<p>The cloud base rests at the <b>height</b> where the temperature of the air reaches down to its dew point. Find this using the <b>DALR</b>.</p>

				<p>The freezing level rests at the <b>height above cloud base</b> where the dew point reaches 0<sup>o</sup>C (freezing point of water). Find this using the <b>SALR</b>.</p>

				<p>Since we use surface temperature to calculate the cloud base and FZ LVL, the result we get is in <b>AGL</b>. Add the <b>elevation of the METAR/TAF station</b> 
					to get ASL values.</p>

				<p>Example:</p>
				<div class="code-block">
				<p>Elev: 900' ASL, Temp: 24<sup>o</sup>C, DP: 15<sup>o</sup>C</p>
				<p>Height of Cloud base (DALR) = (24 - 15) / 3 x 1000' AGL = 3000' AGL or (3000 + 900 =) 3900' ASL</p>
				<p>FZ LVL (SALR) = 15 / 1.5 x 1000 + 3000 (cloud base) = 13000' AGL or (13000 + 900 =) 13900' ASL</p>
				</div></li><br/>

			<h2 id="air-masses-fronts">IV. Air masses and fronts</h2>

			<ul>

				<li><p id="air-masses"><u>Air masses</u></p>
					<p>Large bodies (masses) of air usually 1000 miles or longer having similar properties of temperature and moisture in the <b>horizontal</b>. Best source 
					regions for air masses are large, flat areas (either land or water) where the air can stay stagnant for a long time to acquire the properties of the land 
					(or water) below. This also means that a <b>high pressure</b> area will be the <b>best region</b> for the creation of an air mass <i>(due to light winds and fair 
					weather associated with a high pressure area leading to restricted movement of air)</i>.</p>

					<p>Air masses are classified/named based on their moisture content (continental/maritime) and source region (arctic/polar/tropical). This leads to the 
						following six combination of air masses:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><p>Continental Arctic (Cold and dry)</p></li>
							<li><p>Maritime Arctic (Cold and moist)</p></li>
							<li><p>Continental Polar (Cool and dry)</p></li>
							<li><p>Maritime Polar (Cool and moist)</p></li>
							<li><p>Continental Tropical (Warm and dry)</p></li>
							<li><p>Maritime Tropical (Warm and moist)</p></li>
						</ul>

					<p><b>In Canada</b>, Continental Polar and Continental Tropical air masses are very rare. The most common types of air masses in Canada are:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><p>Continental Arctic (Winter)</p></li>
						<li><p>Maritime Arctic (Winter/Summer)</p></li>
						<li><p>Maritime Polar (Winter/Summer)</p></li>
						<li><p>Maritime Tropical (Winter/Summer)</p></li>
					</ul>

					<p><b>Maritime arctic</b> air dominates the Canadian weather picture during the winter months. It's interesting to note that this kind of air mass can 
					even form during the summer and in the interior, far away from oceans, due to the presence of a large number of lakes in Canada. This is responsible for 
					bringing in showers in the interior in summer.</p>
				</li><br/>

				<li><p id="air-mass-heights"><u>Air mass heights</u></p>
				
				<p>An air mass is <b>always topped by the tropopause</b>. The warmer the air mass, the higher it will cause the tropopause to be (owing to the need for it 
				to rise higher to cool down to its lowest temperature). This also means that the tropopause over a warmer air mass (such as maritime tropical) will be 
				<b>higher</b> than that of, say, a continental arctic air mass.</p>
				</li><br/>

				<li><p id="air-mass-modification"><u>Air mass modification</u></p>
				
				<p>Over time, an air mass can get modified by acquiring the properties of the new area that it moves to. This can change the moisture content, temperature 
					as well as the stability of the air mass depending on whether it gets heated or cooled from below. The extent of modification will depend on <b>how 
						long</b> the air mass stays stagnant in the new region, its <b>speed</b> and the moisture content and temperature of the new region.</p>

						<p>If an air mass gets cooled from below, an inversion may occur. If it gets heated from below, instability can occur. The instability can even mix 
							up in to the higher levels of the atmosphere, especially in the presence of a steep lapse rate.</p>
				</li><br/>

				<li><p id="fronts"><u>Fronts</u></p>

				<p>It's the boundary layer between a <b>warmer and colder</b> air mass formed when one moves in to the zone of another. Air masses <i>generally</i> do not mix, 
				hence the formation of a front. Fronts may be stationary, <i>quasi</i> stationary or moving. The momevent of the front is dependent on the momevent of the colder 
				air mass. At a front, the warmer, lighter air mass rises above the colder, heavier air mass. Fronts are located along <b>troughs of low pressure systems</b>. 
				The weather pattern changes ahead, at and behind front. </p>

				<p>Different types of fronts are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p><b>Cold front</b>: Colder air moving into warmer air zone lifting it up (frontal lift) along a <b>steep slope</b>. Usually spread over average 
					distances of up to 50 NM.</p></li>

					<li><p><b>Warm front</b>: Warmer air moving into colder air zone rising up along a gentler slope compared to that of a cold front. Usually spread up to 
					greater distances than cold fronts, up to 600 NM.</p></li>

					<li><p><b>Stationary front</b>:</p></li>

					<li><p><b>Occluded front/trowal</b></p></li>

					<li><p><b>Upper front</b>:</p></li>
				</ul>
				</li><br/>

				<li><p><u>Winter Warm front</u></p>
				<p></p></li><br/>

				<li><p titl="frontal-weather"><u>Frontal weather</u></p>
					
				<p>Fronts only serve as transition (or, sometimes, <i>mixing</i>) zones between the air masses and the actual <b>frontal weather</b> exists many miles ahead 
				or behind the front. Frontal weather happens in the direction of the <i>frontal zone</i>, <b>along the frontal slope</b>, and will largely depend on the 
				stability and moisture content of the warm air mass, the speed of the cold air mass and the <b>gradient of the slope</b> along which the warmer air nass 
				rises above the colder air mass. In the case of a cold front, the advancing colder air mass has the frontal zone <b>behind</b> itself, so the frontal weather 
				takes place behind it <i>(vice versa for a warm front)</i>. The position of the warmer air mass along the frontal slope is a big determinant of the weather 
				at that point.</p>
				
				<p>Below is a tabulation of the general weather pattern expected in the various stages of the passing of fronts.</p><br/>
