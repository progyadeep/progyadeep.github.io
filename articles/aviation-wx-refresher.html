	<h2>I. Pressure Systems</h2>

	<ul>

		<li><p><u>High Pressure (northern hemisphere)</u></p>
		<p>Caused by cold, sinking air. Movement of air around a high pressure centre is clockwise, diverging away from the centre (anti-cyclonic).</p>

		<p>Fair weather- fewer clouds due to suppression of upward convective currents, light winds, good visibility. High pressure systems can stay stationary for long periods.</p>
		</li><br/>

		
		<li><p><u>Low pressure (northern hemisphere)</u></p>
		<p>Caused by hot, rising air. Movement of air aroind a low pressure centre is anti-clockwise and converging toward the centre (cyclonic).</p>

		<p>Bad weather- more clouds due to increased upward convetive currents, strong winds, precipitation, bad visibility. Often cause thunderstorms. Low pressure systems move quickly and at an angle to the isobars seen on wx maps (faster in winter than summer).</p>
		</li><br/>


		<li><p><u>Troughs</u></p>

		<p>Elongated areas of low pressure [low pressure lines]. Passage of a trough follows surface level wind shift, clouds and precipitation. Often associated with fronts.</p>
		</li><br/>


		<li><p><u>Ridges</u></p>

		<p>Elongated areas of high pressure [high pressure lines] with a low pressure system on each side. Fair weather is associated.</p>
		</li><br/>


		<li><p><u>Cols</u></p>

		<p>Neutral region between <b>two highs and two lows</b>. Weather tends to be unsettled. Fog is expected in winter and showers and thunderstorms in summer.</p>
		</li><br/>
	</ul><br/>

	<h2>II. Altimetry</h2>
	<ul>
	
		<li><p><u>Effect of temperature</u></p>

		<p>Rise in temperature <i>momentarily</i> increases the pressure of the air column which makes the air molecules spread vertically to try to maintain a 
		uniform pressure throughout its mass. This causes ambient air pressure to change <b>less</b> with increase in altitude. As a result, you have go higher than normal for the 
		same change in altimeter reading. Hence, the <b>true altitude increases</b> when the air is warm [typical in summer].</p>

		<p>Fall in temprature makes the cold air sink below causing steeper pressure changes with altitude. Hence, you have to climb less to see the same 
		change in altimeter reading which puts you at a <b>lower true altitude</b> [typical in winter]. </p>
		</li><br/>


		<li><p><u>Flying in to a different temperature zone</u></p>

		<p>Just like your true altitude increases in warmer temperatures (and vice versa), flying in to a warmer zone - without resetting your altimeter QNH - will put you at a <b>higher true altitude</b>, meaning you'll end up 			being <b>higher than you think</b>. The reverse is true for flying in to colder zones- you'll end up <b>lower than you think</b>.</p></li><br/>


		<li><p><u>Flying in to a different pressure zone</u></p>

		<p>The higher the pressure value you set in your altimeter (Altimeter subscale setting or QNH), the higher of an altitude it will <b>indicate</b> at the same pressure level. If you fly in to an area that has a lower 		pressure than where you were before, you need to dial down the QNH for the altimeter to show the proper indicated altitude. Failure to do so will show a <b>higher indicated altiude than your actual/true altitude</b>, so 		you'll end up being <b>lower than you think</b>. The reverse is true if you fly in to an area of higher pressure.</p><br/>

		<i>~ Remember ~</i> Your indicated altitude is still susceptible to the effects of temperature. Setting the correct pressure setting does not relieve you of the responsibility to take in to account the error in your 		indicated altitude due to the actual temperature in the region you're in. Whatever regions you fly in will still have you at a <b>much different true altitude</b> if their actual temperatures are too different from 		standard.</li><br/>

		
		<li><p><u>True Altitude</u></p>

		<p>It's your real altitude found by correcting <b>IAlt AGL</b> for temperature <i>(AGL because the altimeter setting valid at any point is supposed to be the atmospheric pressure observed on the ground below you reduced 		to sea level pressure, so the error is supposedly encountered after you climbed up from the ground below you, not from SEA LEVEL!)</i>. <b>Your altimeter is always lying to you</b>, so to find out by how much 
		your altimeter is off, you can use the following formula:</p>

		<p style="color:#898989"><big><i>Alt. corr. = 4<sup>o</sup>C ~ per 1000' AGL ~ per <sup>o</sup>C ISA deviation @ P.A. </i></big></p>

		<p><i>~ Note ~</i> The altitude taken in to the formula is the Indicated (or Calibrated) height AGL but the temperature deviation should be for the <b>Pressure Alt</b>.

		<p style="color:#898989">~ Example ~ IAlt: 13,500'; A2952; OAT 25<sup>o</sup>C; Elev: 3000'</p>
		<p style="color:#898989">P.A. = 13,900', I.S.A Temp @ 13,900' = 15 - 1.98 x 13.9 = -12.5<sup>o</sup>C; deviation = +37.5<sup>o</sup>C</p>
		<p style="color:#898989">IAlt AGL = 13,500' - 3000' = 10,500'</p>
		<p style="color:#898989"><b>Alt. corr. = 4 x 10.5 x 37.5 = 1575'</b></p>
		<p style="color:#898989"><b>True ALT = 13,500 + 1575 = 15,075' <u>ASL</u></b></p>

		<p>Alternatively, use the values for P.A., OAT and IAlt (CAlt) AGL on the <b>E6B</b> flight computer (produces slightly different answer, in the above example we get T.A. = <b>15,000' ASL</b>).</p>
		</li><br/>


		<li><p><u>Actual altitude</u></p>

		<p>It's your actual height AGL or true altitude AGL, found by subtracting terrain elevation from true altitude AMSL.</p>
		<p>In the above example, Absolute ALT = 15,075' - 3000' = 12,075' AGL.</p>
		</li><br/>

	<h2>III. Heat &amp; Moisture</h2>
	<ul>

		<li><p><u>Temperature Inversion</u></p>

		<p>A phenomenon where atmospheric temperature increases with altitude, or the standard lapse rate is <b>inverted</b>. Often caused due to radiation cooling of the surface wherein the radiated heat heats 
		up a higher level of the atmosphere and the air in immediate contact with the thus cool ground gets cooled from below [common at night]. Strong inversions can also occur when cold air flows in to valleys 
		and gets trapped while sinking air on leeward sides of mountains warm due to compression by increasing atmospheric pressure without going all the way to the ground.</p>

		<p>Any convective activity that is resumed when the land is heated again gets <i>capped</i> at the warmer air layer as the rising moist air now spreads horizontally instead of vertically. Usually leads to 
		very stable weather. Visibility can be poor due to the entrapment fog, dew and pollution in the lower level below the warm layer. Stratifrom clouds appear which may lead to light steady precipitation. <b>Wind shears</b> 
		can be encountered after takeoff in the presence of a <b>strong temperature inversion</b>.</p>

		<p>If convective activity is <i>too much</i> it can break through the inversion layer leading to strong thunderstorms.</p>
		</li><br/>

		<li>
		<p><u>Stability and instability</u><p>

		<p>Cooler air near the surface causes stable weather due to absence of heat as a convective lifting agent. Consequently, warmer air aloft contributes to stable weather by restricting cloud formation which, 
		along with the absence of orographic agents, reduces mechanical turbulence. However, the amount of convective energy suppressed by the inversion will dictate the degree of unstable weather should the inversion get broken 			through by heavy convective activity.</p>

		<p>It should be noted, however, that the biggest determinant of atmospheric stability is the <b>environmental lapse rate</b>. The steepr it is, the more unstable the atmosphere will be due to steeper temperature changes 
		experienced by the rising air.</p>
		</li><br/>
	

		<li><p><u>Humidity &amp; Adiabatic lapse rate</u></p>

		<p>Humidity is a measure of the amount of moisture contained by air. <b>Relative humidity</b> is the amount of moisture contained by air expressed as a percentage of the total amount of moisture it can hold at a given 			temperature. A drop in temperature or addition of moisture can both increase the relative humidity. <b>Dew point</b> is the temperature that air must be cooled to to become saturated. Temperature/dew point spread is 		indicative of 	the chances of cloud and fog formation.</p>

		<p>Sometimes air molecules within a parcel of air may release or absorb heat to or from other molecules in the same parcel instead of the surrounding atmosphere. This is known as an adiabatic process.</p>

		<p>Unsaturated air cools faster than saturated air. The former cools at a rate of 3<sup>o</sup>C per 1000', known as the <b>Dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR)</b>. The latter cools at a rate of 1.5<sup>o</sup>C per 1000', 			known as <b>saturated adiabatic lapse rate (SALR)</b>. Change in relative humidity/saturation of air is the result of adiabatic heat exchange.</p>
		</li><br/>


		<li><p><u>Height of cloud base & freezing level</u></p>

		<p>The cloud base rests at the <b>height</b> where the temperature of the air reaches down to its dew point. Find this using the <b>DALR</b>.</p>

		<p>The freezing level rests at the <b>height above cloud base</b> where the dew point reaches 0<sup>o</sup>C (freezing point of water). Find this using the <b>SALR</b>.</p>

		<p>Since we use surface temperature to calculate the cloud base and FZ LVL, the result we get is in <b>AGL</b>. Add the <b>elevation of the METAR/TAF station</b> to get ASL values.</p>

		<p style="color:#898989"><i>~ Example ~</i></p>
		<p style="color:#898989">Elev: 900' ASL, Temp: 24<sup>o</sup>C, DP: 15<sup>o</sup>C</p>
		<p style="color:#898989">Height of Cloud base (DALR) = (24 - 15) / 3 x 1000' AGL = 3000' AGL or (3000 + 900 =) 3900' ASL</p>
		<p style="color:#898989">FZ LVL (SALR) = 15 / 1.5 x 1000 + 3000 (cloud base) = 13000' AGL or (13000 + 900 =) 13900' ASL</p></li><br/>
