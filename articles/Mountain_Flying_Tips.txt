(1) ALTITUDE
-------------

Make sure to be 3000' or more above the highest peak in the vicinity or at 
least the general height of the surrounding terrain. At least 2000' is advisable 
if unable to go higher due to aircraft's service ceiling or cruising 
altitude/airspace restriction, or if unable to fly above a PA of 10,000' in 
an unpressurized aircraft.



(2) AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE
-------------------------
	(a) Make sure to double check the expected density altitude. Lean 
	mixture for BEST POWER if temperature is significantly higher than 
	standard (otherwise follow POH recommendation). Make sure your aircraft 
	can produce acceptable power at altitude.

	(b) The higher you go, the lower your aircraft's performance gets. Being 
	light by avoiding carriage of non-essential baggage is a good idea. 
	Having less fuel than your aircraft's full capacity can also help lessen 
	your gross weight but ONLY COMPROMISE ON YOUR F.O.B. IF IT DOESN'T 
	JEOPARDIZE SAFETY.

	(c) Be mindful of your aircraft's manoeuvering speed (Va). IT CHANGES WITH 
	YOUR GROSS WEIGHT.



(3) COLD TEMPERATURE
----------------------
If the temperature is significantly lower, you may think all your problems are 
solved because the aircraft can produce a lot of power but always remember that 
your altimeter is erroneous even in standard temperatures, so in colder 
temperatures your true altitude can be significantly lower than indicated.

Downdrafts can also be more pobable and can cause your altimeter to UNDER-READ by 
as much as 3000'.



	*************************************************************************
	*	If you can, keep an eye on your GPS ALTITUDE using your 	*
	*	aircraft's GPS or iPad as well to make sure you're within 	*
	*	a certain limit of your planned altitude.			*

(4) SUNSHINE
-------------
Sunshine can cause mountain tops to heat up to temperatures significantly higher 
than the predicted temperature at a given pressure level in the general area. If 
it's a bright sunny day, turbulence, mountain waves and even loss of performance 
can be predicted. Avoiding flying over terrain with steep elevation gradients is 
advisable.





(5) VALLEYS
------------
Stay on the sunny side to avoid getting caught in downdrafts. If downdrafts are not 
of major concern, stay on the RIGHT SIDE of valleys- just like you would while driving 
on an undivided road or highway.



(6) COMMUNICATION
------------------
	(a) Actively listen and broadcast your position on the VFR Enroute frequency 
	(126.7 MHz). Feel free to talk to people - who are already in or past the 
	area you're about to fly into - about the situation in that area. Be a good 
	samaritan and warn others of hazardous weather phenomenon and make PIREPs to 
	FIC or the nearest ground station. Check for already issued PIREPs before 
	taking off.

	(b) It's perfectly OKAY to climb to an altitude that's not a standard cruising 
	altitude for your track's bearing, in an attempt to avoid turbulence (That 
	doesn't mean you should always cruise at 10,000 in a C172 no matter your 
	bearing!). In such cases, broadcast that information on 126.7 MHz in your 
	position reports.

	(c) Note down enroute frequencies- UNICOM, enroute aerodromes, FIC/FISE RCOs, 
	ACC PALs and any other enroute frequencies in use in the area.

	(d) Keep 126.7 MHz clear or non-essential chatter! Remember, you're not only 
	broadcasting/listening to people in your vicinity but all aircraft on that 
	frequency that your signal can reach to. Depending on your height, people 
	as far as 200 NM or more can hear you and your unnecessary chatter can 
	disrupt essential communication in their area!



(7) NAVIGATION & PLANNING
---------------------------
	(a) Don't rely on eyeballing your way through the mountains. Study the maps and 
	charts as thoroughly as you can. Take advantage of your	existence in the 21st 
	century and use Google Earth and online highway and weather station cameras to 
	get a clear view of the terrain as well as weather.

	(b) Make sure your checkpoints are clearly identifiable and pin-point-able. Many 
	small valleys and roads can look the same and it'll take no time for you to get 
	lost (and worse- DISORIENTED) if you're not 100% sure where you're going.

	(c) Make sure to have the bearing of your tracks (not just wind-corrected headings 
	but also the actual track the you're going to fly) and stick to your planned route 
	as closely as is practicable.

	(d) Use a timer to time your legs and calculate revised ground speeds and/or ATAs 
	to make sure you're not burning way more fuel than expected.

	(e) Choose a route with suitable landing areas or airports on the way. REMEMBER 
	that the terrain under you is NOT AT SEA LEVEL and you have way less altitude to 
	glide through than indicated.

	(f) Cross ridges at a 45 degree angle. This angle is optimal because it gives you a 
	view ahead of the ridge before you've crossed it without making the crossing too 
	long.

	(g) Practice doing "box-canyon" turns- which is a steep turn at reduced airspeed- 
	with an experienced instructor before mountain flying by yourself. Train your brain 
	to feel comfortable doing 180 degree turns and going back in case you encounter 
	clouds or terrain ahead. NEVER try to out climb terrain you didn't expect to 
	encounter. Get rid of GET-THERE-ITIS!

	(h) FILE A FLIGHT PLAN with the FIC and type in your route as closely as possible to 
	your actual intended route. One way of doing it is using the closest GPS WPTS from 
	your route using the LO chart. You can also mention this verbally over the phone. 
	Be as detailed (yet concise) in providing information to FIC.







(8) MAPS & CHARTS
------------------
The skill to be able to relate the actual terrain with the charts and maps in-flight is 
essential and gives you a very clear picture of the terrain very quickly. Get comfortable 
predicting how features such as settlements, valleys, roads, rivers. etc. will look in real 
life based on how they appear on the charts.



(9) WHITEOUT
-------------
Bright sunshine can blind you and make you lose your perception of the horizon only 2 seconds 
of which is enough to cause you to fly in to the ground. Snow covered terrain can also make you 
lost and disoriented. The combination of bright sunshine and snow covered terrain is the worst!
Make sure to check weather cams and reports to make sure the topographical features you plan to 
fly over are distinguishable.



(10) COMMON SENSE ITEMS
------------------------
	(a) Carry appropriate and adequate survival equipment for all persons on board. Warm 
	jackets, food and water, an axe and means to start a fire are customary mountain/jungle 
	survival equipment.

	(b) Be out of the mountains well before it gets dark.

	(c) Watch out, don't be distracted, stay ahead of your aicraft at all times!
